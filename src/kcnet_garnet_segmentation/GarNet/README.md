# GarNet
## Introduction

We introduce an approach to predict the shapesand discretised weights of garments through learning garment-physical similarity. Prior knowledge about discretised weightsand shapes of garments facilitates robotsâ€™ abilities to manip-ulate those garments. Therefore our approach can potentiallyintroduce a robot dexterous garment manipulation. We intro-duce a garment similarity network (GarNet) that achieves aprediction accuracy of 98% for unseen garment shapes and95% for unseen garment discretised weights.

My name is Li Duan (Ken) and I am a 3rd-year PhD student @ University of Glasgow, Scotland. My interests include robot continuous perception and deformable object manipulation. Recently, I am working on investigating geometric and physical properties of fabrics and garments, from which I am keen on engineering methods to improve robot deformable object manipulations.\
